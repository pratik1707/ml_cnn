Steps to Build a CNN for Classification
Prepare the Dataset:

Collect labeled images of dogs and cats.
Split the dataset into training, validation, and testing sets.
Preprocess the Data:

Resize all images to a uniform size (e.g., 128x128 pixels).
Normalize pixel values to a range of 0 to 1 for better performance.
Augment the data with techniques like rotation, flipping, and zooming to increase variability.
Design the CNN:

Start with a few convolutional layers to extract features.
Add pooling layers to reduce dimensionality.
Flatten the output and feed it into dense layers for classification.
Train the Model:

Use the training data to train the model.
Monitor performance on the validation set to avoid overfitting.
Evaluate the Model:

Test the trained CNN on unseen images to measure accuracy.
Make Predictions:

Use the model to classify new images as either "dog" or "cat."
